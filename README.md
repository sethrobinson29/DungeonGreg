# DungeonGreg
A quick, console-based game I made over Winter 2021 break.

			||------------------- How To Play ---------------------||
			||------------------ Dungeon Greg ---------------------||
			||-----------------------------------------------------||
			||-----------------------------------------------------||

			Greg has wandered into a dungeon of unknown size with rooms
				potentially full of enemies to fight. Using the keyboard, you
				will guide Greg through the mysterious caverns of your imagination
				Each room could hold 1-4 enemies, and there can be 2-9 rooms per dungeon
				although the 9th room would be a real challenge if you made it.
        
				THIS GAME IS NOT BALANCED.
        
				It was really just a way to work on programming over Winter 2021 break,
				and I plan to come back and make some changes in the future.

			||--------------------- Controls ----------------------||
			||-----------------------------------------------------||
			Once you have pushed greg into a dungeon instance, or made your
				own character to torment,  press WASD to walk to the next block.
				If any enemy resides in that square, you will have an encounter.
				In an encounter, 'A' will attack, 'L' will attempt to escape
				the encounter and the dungeon- taking greg, or you, back to the
				main menu. and 'I' will allow greg to use one of the items listed
				below:
			||----------------------- Items -----------------------||
			POTION: restores 50 hp to the player.
      BOMB: deals 25 damage instantly to enemy.
      WATCH: freezes time for one turn, allowing the player to
				      get an extra attack, or a guaranteed escape.


Dungeon Greg was just meant to help me practice coding while school was out. I plan to come back in the future
  and update the game further: expanding the map and allowing it to display enemy locations and obstacles, 
  as well as optimizing some of the code. 
  
THIS GAME IS NOT BALANCED, IF YOU PLAY IT YOU MAY NOT BEAT IT. 

You could get a small, quick dungeon, or you could get 9 rooms with 4 enemies each.
